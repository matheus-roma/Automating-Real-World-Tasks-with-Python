# Automatically generate a pdf and send it by email
Week 3 of Automating Real-World Tasks with Python

The premisse of this task it's that you work for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wants to get a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. The company already has a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wants an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.

For this lab, a Roundcube Webmail account was provided. Unfortunatelly this was deleted after the test.
